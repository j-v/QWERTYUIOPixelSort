#QWERTYUIOPixelSort

Make animations and stills with the pixel sorting algorithm.

Based on kimasendorf's [ASDFPixelSort](https://github.com/kimasendorf/ASDFPixelSort)

## Requirements
- Processing 3
- [ControlP5 library](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/)
- For creating gifs: [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php) static executables, on the command-line PATH

Compile and run pixel sorting GUI app by loading QWERTYUIOPixelSort in [Processing 3](https://processing.org/download/).

You can make gifs using the makegif.py script after generating a sequence from the gui, using the name of the output image folder which is created under the "output" folder.
